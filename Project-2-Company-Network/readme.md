# 🖧 Company Network

## Description

An enterprise company has hired you to set up a LAN for their new headquarters in Krakow. The following are the requirements and the solution implemented for the network in the new building:

### 1. Cisco Packet Tracer Implementation
The entire network topology and configuration are created and simulated in Cisco Packet Tracer.

### 2. IP Addressing
The company has allocated the network address `192.168.1.0/20` for the headquarters.

### 3. Building Structure & VLANs
- The building consists of 4 floors.
- Each department operates on a separate floor and is assigned a unique VLAN and subnet.
- VLANs are used to logically segment the network by department.

### 4. Wireless Connectivity
- The third floor features a wireless access point supporting up to 1000 devices.
- WPA2-PSK authentication is configured; only devices with the correct password can connect.

### 5. Core Routing & Switching
- A core router connects the LAN to the ISP.
- Two multilayer switches are connected to the core router.
- Inter-VLAN Routing is configured on the multilayer switches to allow communication between departments.

### 6. Switching Architecture
- Multilayer switches perform both routing and switching.
- Trunk ports are configured between multilayer switches and 2960 model switches.
- Access ports are configured between 2960 switches and end-devices.

### 7. IP Address Management
- All devices obtain their IP addresses dynamically from a DHCP server located in the server room.
- Devices in the server room have static IP addresses.

### 8. Routing Protocol
- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is used for routing between routers and multilayer switches.
- OSPF ensures efficient route advertisement and redundancy.

### 9. Network Address Translation
NAT is configured on the core router to enable internet access for internal devices.

### 10. Additional Services
- DNS server provides name resolution for all devices.
- Security is ensured via VLAN segmentation, WPA2 wireless authentication, and static IP allocation for critical systems.

## Implementation Details

- OSPF is used as the routing protocol on all routers and multilayer switches.
- NAT is implemented on the core router for outside connectivity.
- Inter-VLAN Routing is set up on multilayer switches for internal communication.
- DHCP server automatically provides IP addresses to all devices except those in the server room (which use static IPs).
- DNS server is configured for all devices.
- Trunk ports are set up for switch-to-switch connections; access ports are set for end-device connections.
- Wireless access point configured for high device capacity and security.
- VLANs established for each department, ensuring traffic isolation and management.
- Redundancy and scalability considered in design.
